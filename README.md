This library uses [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html)-CLI-Tool to extract data (fps, aspect-ratio, size, duration,
â€¦) from any video on your hard drive.

## Installation

1. Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (we only need ffprobe, ffprobe is included in ffmpeg). The library
   will use the CMD-Library by default, unless the `FFPROBE_EXEC` environment variable is specified.
2. Install get-video-metadata from NPM: `npm i --save get-video-metadata`
3. Enjoy ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

```javascript
import getVideoMetadata from "get-video-metadata";

getVideoMetadata('./test.mp4').then(console.log)
/* Output: 
{
  codec: {
    name: 'h264',
    longName: 'H.264 / AVC / MPEG-4 AVC / MPEG-4 part 10',
    type: 'video'
  },
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
  width: '1280',
  height: '720',
  frameRate: 30,
  bitRate: '2477866',
  duration: '10.933333'
}
*/
```

Note: This also work with image files, but this library was designed for videos. Please also note that `code.type` will
always be "video", as this is the way we are telling ffprobe to parse the video.
